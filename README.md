Employee Management Application

The course project is designed to be completed over the five weeks of the term. At the end of each week, you will need to turn in a work product representing a portion of the project. It is also a check for you to make sure you are progressing toward on-time completion.

Project Scenario/Instructions
For this project you will have the opportunity to choose from one of three project options, each with their own specific requirements. For each of the project options, the design of the user interface is entirely up to you as the developer. As the course does not cover any GUI technologies, a graphical interface is not required. If you are comfortable with creating a web interface for your application, you may create a web-based interface. Otherwise, you will need to create a console application with a command line interface.
